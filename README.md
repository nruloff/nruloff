I am Nicholas Ruloff. I am currently a Protein Research Scientist working for a small biomimetic membrane company, as well as a student of Data Science earning my degree at thr University of Michigan. 
I am interested in multiple aspects of Data Science, namely:
 1) Automatic data analysis of raw data collected in the wet chemistry lab
 2) Compiling results of said data analysis into large databases
 3) Creating machine learning models based on the database results to add direction to experiments performed in the wet chemistry lab
 4) Studying computational biology and protein folding
